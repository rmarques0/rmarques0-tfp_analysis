### Total Factor Productivity (TFP)


Economists have found that they can explain only a portion of economic growth by the growth of inputs to production, such as the number of hours worked or the amount of capital used. The unexplained (or residual) portion, which presumably reflects advances in production technologies and processes, is conventionally attributed to all of the production factors together and is referred to as Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth.

The measure of TFP is based on 39 variables that measure relative levels of income, output, inputs and productivity for 167 countries between 1950 and 2011.

Even though estimates of TFP provide a measure of many elements of economic progress, they fail to capture large and important historical improvements in well-being, such as leasure time, improvements in life expectancy resulted from technological inventions or even environmental regulations. However, medical advances, by improving labor productivity and extending working lives, may indirectly contribute to growth in measured GDP. The data show little improvement in TFP in health care despite dramatic and continuous improvements in health and despite an average increase in life expectancy at birth of about two and a half years per decade over the past century and a half. 

Productivity growth is often assossiated with new products, tools and processes that reduce costs of estraction and/or transcorming inputs into finished products.

From 90's to 2000's, the TFP showed a global growth trend concentrated in manufacture sactor, and particularly in Information Technology. 

Although forecasters generally project relatively strong continued growth in TFP, theu worry that it'll become increasingly difficult to increase the educational attainment of a labor force when the great majority of workers already have at least a high-school degree and a large portion have attended college. Some observers express further concern that resource constraints (such as rising costs of fossil fuel extraction and changes in climate resulting from the burning of fossil fuels) will require continual innovations and continual increases in expenditures simply to maintain current productivity levels. Much as the key innovations of the late 19th century were not fully exploited until the big wave of TFP growth occurred several decades later, recent innovations in information technology, communications, medicine, and elsewhere may yield substantial growth well into the future. 

**Over the long term, TFP growth is limited only by the ability of innovators to develop new technologies, and that a larger population makes possible a larger pool of talent to be devoted to research, and thus opens up more potential for innovation.**
